This project is just my attempt to learn Amazon DynamoDB and get familar
with the AWS Java SDK.

A lot of the code examples are modified from:

<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-dynamodb-examples>


Lots of documentation on the API can be found at the
[AWS DynamoDB Java](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/gettingstartedguide/GettingStarted.Java.html) page.
